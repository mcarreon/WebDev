#If it's a new server, update apt-get first thing
sudo apt-get update
#then you can install something - say Git
sudo apt-get install git
###Copy/Deploy files###

###Generate an SSH keypair for passwordless SSH###

#on your computer
cd ~/.ssh
#you might need to make the .ssh directory
ssh-keygen -C "my@email.com"
#hit enter a few times to generate key

#copy the file contents to the clipboard
cat id_rsa.pub | pbcopy

#log into your machine
ssh user@mydomain.com
#make the .ssh directory and get in it
mkdir .ssh
cd .ssh
#open authorized_keys in nano and paste the contents in
nano authorized_keys
#paste contents in and save by hitting ctrl+x

#exit and you can now ssh without a password!
