Tables: 

Basic table exp
< table border=”1” >
    < tr >
        < td >Row 1, Column 1< /td >
        < td >Row 1, Column 2< /td >
    < /tr >
    < tr >
        < td >Row 2, Column 1< /td >
        < td >Row 2, Column 2< /td >
    < /tr >
< /table >

Start each row and cell on a new line and indent table cells inside table rows as shown 
If a row or column contains a heading, <th> should be used in place of <td>

Each cell must be represented by either a <td> or a <th> element in order for the table todisplay correctly, even if there is no data in the cell. 

To place markup inside a table, it must nest within a table element. 

Basic Table Elements and Attributes: 

<table>
    all universal attributes
    basic event attributes for scripting
    Attributes: 
        rtl or ltr: right to left and vice versa
        summary: provides summary for non visual browsers or broken tables, not rendered. 

<tr> Table rows
    carries 5 attributes
        char: anchors allignment around an axis char ie. "." for cdecimal numbers
            not supported at time of book
        charoff: offset for the char attribute

<td> and <th> Represent Table Cells
    th are displayed in bold, and center horizontally aligned
    td are left aligned and not in bold 
    attributes only apply to the oe cell carrying it, overrides settings for table and any containing element
        abbr: provides abbreviated version of content
        axis: create variables ie. axis="heavy, old, valuable"
            preserves data
        char: similar to tr
        charoff: sim to tr
        colspan: used when a cell should span across more than one column 
        headers: indicate which headers correspond to the cell 
            supports voice browsers
        rowspan: specifies the number of rows of the table a cell will span across
        scope: indicates which cells the current header provides a label or header information for. 
            does not have much support

<caption>
    appears directly after the opening <table> tag and before the first row
        used by screen readers and search engines

Grouping sections of a Table: 
    spanning using the colspan:
        colspan starting at the cell and to the right
    spanning using rowspan:
        rowspan starting at the left and moves to the right

Splitting up tables using a Head, Body, and Foot
    distinguish the body (data) and the headings or footers.
    if table is too long for one screen, headings and footers can be turned into scroll bars
        main browsers do not support at time of book
    can use CSS to attach diofferent styles to the contents of the <thead><tbody><tfoot> elements 
        <thead>: creates separate table header
        <tbody>: indicates main body
            can have multiple <tbody> to indicate different groups of data
        <tfoot>: creates separate table footer 
            must appear before the <tbody> element in the source doc
        all three elements can carry the universal attributes

Grouping Columns Using the <colgroup> element
example, must be before <tr>
    < table >
        <colgroup span=”4” class=”mainColumns” />
        <colgroup span=”2” class=”subTotalColumns” />
        < tr >
            < td > 1 < /td >
            < td > 2 < /td >
            < td > 3 < /td >
            < td > 4 < /td >
            < td > 5 < /td >
            < td > 6 < /td >
        < /tr >
    < /table >

Column Sharing Styles Using the <col> 
    used to specify attribues of the columns in a <colgroup> 
    does not imply structural grouping, used for presentation 
    <colgroup span=”6”>
        < col span=”5” class=”mainColumns” / >
        < col span=”1” class=”totalColumn” / >
    < /colgroup >

Nested Tables: 
    can nest a table inside a <td> 

Accessible Tables: 
    tables contain a lot of data and are good visual reps
    for those on a voice browser or screen reader tables are hard to understand
        add captions
        always use <th> for headings
        always put heading in the first row and second column
        avoid nested tables
        avoid rowspan and colspan, use scope and header attributes if they are used
        Learn how vb or sr would read a table
        use scope and headers attributes to clearly indicate which headings apply to which rows and columns 

How to Linearize Tables: 
    screen readers do linearization, the reader starts at the first row and reads the cells from left to right then moves to next row. 
    Using id, scope, and headers attributes
        adding scope to <th> helps indicate which cells that element is the heading for
            if you give it value of row, that element is the header for that row
            col - header for that column
            have values for rowgroup and colgroup
        headers does the opposite role to the scope, as used on <td> elements to indicate which headers corrsepond to that cell
