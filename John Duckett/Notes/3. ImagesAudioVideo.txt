Images Audio and Video

Images are added with the 
    <img>: element
Has two attributes, the src "source of an image", and alt, "description of the image"

Valid Attributes
src alt align border height width hspace vspace ismap usemap longdesc name

SRC:
src tells you where to find the image
images should reside on the site server

ALT:
must appear on every img element, value should be a text description of the image
    shows when image cant be displayed
    screen readers
    search engines pull alt image names

HEIGHT AND WIDTH:

ismap and usemap:
used with image maps

Longdesc:
used to indicate the URL of a doc containing a description for the image in more detail.

ImageMaps:
Two types
    Client-side image maps: Tells the browser how the image will be divided up
        use the <map> and <area> elements inside an <img> element
            #name on the img element on the attribute on the map element it uses
            map has the name to idetify itself
            area contains the clickable hotspots
                Area has serveral attributes:
                accesskey alt shape coords href nohref target tabindex taborder notab
                    Shape: default is a rectangle, but is required
                    Coords: speciefs the area that is the clickable hotspot 
                        uses params of shape, rectangle - 4 coords, first tow top left, second 2 bottom right
                        circle - 3 coords, first two center third is radius
                        polyhgon - two coordinates for each point, tri - 6, pent 10
                    if areas overlap, the first in code takes precedence
                    href and nohref: if you want to make sure that a part doesnt link, use nohref
                    alt: specifies a text alternative
                    target: specifies which frame or window the page is loaded into
                    tabindex: specify order in which users tab
        use the <map> element inside an <object> element
            similar, but object carries the usemap attribute
    
    Server-side image maps: 
        img sits inside an a element, img carries ismap attribute, tells browser to send the server x,y coordinatesrepresenting what part of the image the user clicked on 

Choosing the Right Image Format:
Most static images on the Web are classified as bitmapped images, divided into a grid of pixels
    GIF:
        lookup table for colors, indexed color format
    JPEG: use for photo-realistic, or subtleshade differences
    PNG: images with flat colors and hard edges 

Adding FLash, Video, and Audio to web pages
Often referred to as rich media 
    many different formats
    do not automatically show the different formats of rich media
    need to learn a new element
<object>
    name of file and where to find, format of fiel, type of plug-in used to play the file
    inside you can use the <param> element to pass extra info to the player
    any markup inside obkect will be shown if the object cannot be rendered. 

Adding Flash Movies
    Youtube example
        <object width=”425” height=”344”>
            <param name=”movie” value=”http://www.youtube.com/v/dMH0bHeiRNg & hl=en & fs=1” > < /param >
                indicates a movie to be loaded along with the URL
            <param name=”allowFullScreen” value=”true”> < /param >
                indicates whether the player should allow the user to view the movie in full-screen mode
            <param name=”allowscriptaccess” value=”always”> < /param >
                used to ensure that the flash movie can be played from different web sites
            <embed src=”http://www.youtube.com/v/dMH0bHeiRNg& hl=en & fs=1”
            type=”application/x-shockwave-flash” allowscriptaccess=”always”
            allowfullscreen=”true” width=”425” height=”344” > < /embed >
        </object>

    Flash to a page
        < object classid=”clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000”
        width=”300” height=”200”
        codebase=”http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/
        swflash.cab” >
            < param name=”movie” value=”motion/flash_sample.swf” / >
                specifies the flash movie
            < param name=”play” value=”true” / >
                specifies for the movie to play automatically
            < param name=”loop” value=”false” / >
                indicates that the movie should not loop
        < embed src=”motion/flash_sample.swf” width=”300” height=”200” play=”true”
        loop=”false” quality=”best” type=”application/x-shockwave-flash”
        pluginspage=”http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?
        P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash” > < /embed >
        src attribute indicates where, the height and width indicates player
        < /object >

    Adding flash using SWFObject
        create a div to hold the Flash movie, then use CSS to make the div the same width and height as the SWF file, should also have an id attribute to uniquely identify that element. 
    < ?xml version=”1.0” ? >
    < !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN”
    “http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd” >
    < html xmlns=”http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml” lang=”en” xml:lang=”en” >
    < head >
        < title > Adding a flash movie with SWF Object < /title >
        <script type=”text/javascript” src=”swfobject.js”> < /script >
        <script type=”text/javascript”>swfobject.embedSWF(“flash/flash_sample.swf”, “flash_movie”, “300”, “200”, “8.0.0”);
        < /script >
    < /head >
< body >
    <div id=”flash_movie”>This element can contain content that search
    engines can index, and which is helpful to those who do not have Flash
    installed. < /div >
< /body >
< /html >
    this method is good for search engines
    good for accessibility purposes

Adding Videos to Your Site
    Two things to consider
        File Format: choose the format of the video
        Plug-in needed to play that type of file
            different formats require different plug-ins to play the movie

Adding Audio to Your Site:
    File format: different types of compression types
    Plug-in needed to play the type of file: visitors need the correct plugin
    MP3:compressed, capped quality
    WAV:not compressed, high quality

Adding Audio using default Media Players
    < object width=”300” height=”42” type=”audio/mpeg” data=”audio/my_music.mp3” >
        < param name=”src” value=”audio/my_music.mp3” / >
        < param name=”autoplay” value=”true” / >
        < param name=”autostart” value=”1” / >
        < embed src=”audio/my_music.mp3” width=”300” height=”42” > < /embed >
    < /object >
