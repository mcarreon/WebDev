To collect information from a visitor, you use a form. 

Intro:

Text input, and submit buttons, used to send the form to the server
    Select boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, and text inputs can also be used

A <form> element can contain the same HTML markup
    When they enter information, a submit button is to be clicked, which indiactes the user has filled out the form
        this then sends the form data to a web server
        once the data arrives
            something processes the data and sends a new web page back which responds to the request or acknowledgement
When data is sent
    sent in name/value pairs. the name corresponds to form control, and the value is what the user has entered, or the value of the option selected 
        each value needs a name to distinguish 
sample: 
    <form action=”http://www.example.org/search.aspx” method=”get”>
        <h3>Search the site</h3>
        <input type=”text” name=”txtSearchItem” />
        <input type=”submit” value=”Search” />
    </form>
each form needs 
    action method
    attributes
        enctype accept accept-charset onsubmit onreset

action
    indactes what happens when the form is submitted
method 
    get - part of url
    post - hides data in HTTP headers
id
    gives form unique identity
name (dep)
    pred to id
onsubmit
    when user clicks submit, an event fires
        value is a script that runs when submit button is pressed
onreset
    some forms have a reset button that clears data
    similar to onsubmit
enctype
    if you use post, enctype specifies how the browser encodes the data 
        application/x-www-form-urlencoded
            standard, cannot send some characters, replaced by other characters
        multipart/form-data
            sends data in parts, where each consec part corresponds to a form control, in the order it appears in the form. used for upload files
    If enctype is not used, browsers use the first value
accept-charset
    diff languages are written in diff character sets
accept
    similar, but sets the content types that the server processing the form can handle
    rarely supported
target
    used with <a> to show where the link should be loaded too
try to keep form elements near the start or end of the doc to avoid whitespace

Form Controls
    text inputs
        input boxes
        single text
        password
        multi-line*
